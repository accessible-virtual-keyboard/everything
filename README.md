# Accessible Virtual Keyboard
Accessible Virtual Keyboard is a tool to help people with disabilities to communicate. The user should be able to type word and sentences using only simple boolean inputs.

See the **[Wiki](https://github.com/hasirak/AccessibleVirtualKeyboard/wiki)** for a description of the API and examples of how you can use the code in your own projects.


All information can be found on the projects **[Confluence](http://confluence.uials.no:8090/display/AVKEYB/Accessible+virtual+keyboard)** page.


This repository is just a collection of submodules to conveniently be able to clone all sub projects in a 
single pull.
